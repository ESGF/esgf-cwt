## Communication methods for the ESGF-CWT

## General communication: deprecate mailing list and move to ESGF Slack

Historically, the ESGF-CWT has communicated using a mailing list (hosted by LLNL). Since all parties are now used to working on Slack as a communication platform, we are moving to the Slack channel ([#cwt](https://esgf-chat.slack.com/archives/C8CQPTQSJ)), within the ESGF Slack workspace, as the location for communication within the group.

## Agendas and notes from meetings

All meeting agendas and minutes will be captured in Markdown documents on this public GitHub repository. 

## Reporting to ESGF XC

The CWT Chairs will report to the ESGF Executive Committee (XC) and prepare presentations for relevant meetings, such as the annual face-to-face. The format of each report will match that requested.

## Discussions about the management and structure of the CWT

Most discussions about the CWT will take place on the ESGF Slack workspace.
Should any member want to raise issues about how the CWT is being managed then they should report their concerns to the ESGF XC.
