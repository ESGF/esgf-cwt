#### Max about ESGF notebooks using Rook WPS 

Last week at the Project Pythia hackathon, students worked on new notebooks for the ESGF cookbook
* Remotely Computing ENSO + Regridding + Calculating Non-Linearity: https://projectpythia.org/esgf-cookbook/notebooks/rooki_enso_nonlinear.html
* Remotely regridding + comparing the output from models locally: https://projectpythia.org/esgf-cookbook/notebooks/ex-regrid-plot.html
* Searching the Globus-Hosted Index and Computing with Rooki: https://projectpythia.org/esgf-cookbook/notebooks/use-intake-esgf-with-rooki.html

They also highlighted the need for an example searching for datasets using intake-esgf, and feeding those datasets into rooki
https://projectpythia.org/esgf-cookbook/notebooks/use-intake-esgf-with-rooki.html

Be on the lookout for some PRs to rooki to expand the documentation, especially chaining operations together 

I would be happy to present on this at our next CWT meeting.
